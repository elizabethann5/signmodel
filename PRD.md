That's a smart move. A detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD) is essential for aligning your team, defining scope, and guiding the development process.

Here is a detailed PRD for the *Auralis Real-Time Sign Language to Text & Speech Translator* project, based on the materials and architecture we've discussed.

# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Auralis Real-Time Sign Language Translator

| Document Version | Date | Status | Prepared By |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1.0 | October 2025 | Draft | AI Assistant |

## 1. Introduction and Goals

### 1.1 Project Overview

[cite_start]The Auralis Real-Time Sign Language Translator is an innovative web application designed to bridge the communication gap between the Deaf/Hard-of-Hearing community and the hearing world[cite: 2]. [cite_start]By leveraging AI, computer vision, and speech synthesis, the system translates live sign language gestures (initially ASL) into spoken English text and speech in real-time[cite: 1, 70].

### 1.2 Target Users

* [cite_start]*Primary User:* Deaf and mute individuals who communicate using sign language[cite: 4, 59].
* [cite_start]*Secondary User:* Hearing individuals (e.g., family, teachers, doctors, customer service agents) who interact with sign language users[cite: 63, 65, 74].

### 1.3 Key Objectives (Success Metrics)

1.  *Real-Time Performance:* Achieve a latency of *under 150ms* from gesture input to final text/speech output to ensure a seamless conversational experience.
2.  [cite_start]*Accuracy (MVP):* Achieve high accuracy (goal for prototype: high accuracy recognition of *20-25 distinct signs*)[cite: 76].
3.  [cite_start]*Accessibility:* Enable effortless communication with anyone, anywhere, closing the inclusivity gap[cite: 59].
4.  [cite_start]*Scalability:* The solution must be deployable as a scalable web application for use in classrooms, hospitals, and customer service environments[cite: 65].

## 2. Scope of Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

### 2.1 Functional Requirements

| ID | Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| *FR1* | Live Video Capture | [cite_start]The frontend must capture live video from the user's webcam or phone camera[cite: 9, 13]. |
| *FR2* | Real-Time Frame Stream | The frontend must stream frames via WebSockets (or similar low-latency protocol) to the backend at *10-15 Frames Per Second (FPS)*. |
| *FR3* | Gesture Detection & Tracking | [cite_start]The backend, via the AI service, must detect and track hands within the video frame[cite: 10, 15, 16]. |
| *FR4* | AI Recognition | [cite_start]The core logic must classify the gestures in real-time using the integrated machine learning model (model inference)[cite: 10, 17, 18]. |
| *FR5* | Text Transcription | [cite_start]The recognized gesture must be instantly converted and outputted as transcribed text[cite: 11, 19, 20]. |
| *FR6* | Speech Synthesis | [cite_start]The transcribed text must be converted to an English voice output using Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology[cite: 11, 21, 22]. |
| *FR7* | Start/Stop Control | A clear button must exist for the user to initiate and stop the translation process. |

### 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| *NFR1* | Low Latency | The entire communication pipeline (FR2 to FR6) must target less than 150ms total latency. |
| *NFR2* | Robustness | [cite_start]The system must work reliably in variable lighting conditions[cite: 11]. |
| *NFR3* | Cross-Browser | The web application must be functional and responsive across modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge). |
| *NFR4* | Scalability | The backend architecture must be designed to handle multiple concurrent users by leveraging non-blocking I/O (WebSockets). |

## 3. Technical Specifications and Architecture

The system is split into three main parts: Frontend, Backend, and AI Model Integration.

### [cite_start]3.1 Technology Stack [cite: 35]

| Component | Technology | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| *Frontend* | HTML5, CSS, JavaScript (WebRTC, Socket.IO Client) | Standard web technologies for maximum portability and camera access. |
| *Backend/Core Logic* | Python (Flask), Flask-SocketIO | Chosen for simplicity, speed, and native compatibility with ML libraries. |
| *Computer Vision* | [cite_start]MediaPipe, OpenCV [cite: 41] | [cite_start]Used for hand tracking and gesture detection[cite: 42]. |
| *AI/ML Framework* | [cite_start]TensorFlow [cite: 39] | [cite_start]Used for model training and inference[cite: 40]. |
| [cite_start]*TTS* | gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) [cite: 43] | [cite_start]Used for Text-to-Speech conversion[cite: 44]. |

### 3.2 System Flow and Data Pipeline

The system operates in a continuous loop:
1.  [cite_start]*Camera Input* (Live video capture) [cite: 13, 14]
2.  [cite_start]*Hand Detection* (Gesture tracking using MediaPipe/OpenCV) [cite: 15, 16]
3.  [cite_start]*AI Recognition* (Model inference via TensorFlow) [cite: 17, 18]
4.  [cite_start]*Python Script* (Converts model output to text) [cite: 46]
5.  [cite_start]*gTTS* (Text-to-Speech Conversion) [cite: 50]
6.  [cite_start]*Text Output* (Transcription displayed) [cite: 19, 20]
7.  [cite_start]*Audio Output* (Voice synthesis played) [cite: 21, 22]

### 3.3 AI Model Integration Contract (API)

The backend integration relies on this contract with the model processing logic:

| Detail | Specification |
| :--- | :--- |
| *Input* | Base64 encoded JPEG string (single video frame) |
| *Event Name (Input)* | video_frame_stream (via WebSocket) |
| *Prediction Return* | String containing the recognized sign language word/phrase. |
| *Event Name (Output)* | translation_output (via WebSocket) |
| *Output Data* | JSON object: {"text": "transcription", "confidence": 0.XX, "audio_b64": "..."} |

## [cite_start]4. Future Scope (Beyond MVP) [cite: 56]

1.  [cite_start]*Multilingual Support:* Extend support beyond ASL to include Indian Sign Language (ISL), British Sign Language (BSL), and others, with speech output in multiple spoken languages[cite: 61].
2.  [cite_start]*Mobile Application:* Develop a native real-time mobile app solution[cite: 64].
3.  [cite_start]*Sentence-Level Translation:* Implement continuous sign language recognition with temporal dynamics to translate entire sentences rather than just isolated words[cite: 31, 32].
4.  [cite_start]*Model Improvement:* Increase vocabulary size and model accuracy across various environments[cite: 76].
